1.computeGridLandUse.cpp

 added condition to WRF NetCDF output format if it is not LCC.  Only output WRF netCDF file for LCC projection


2. toNLCDRaster_new1.cpp
  a. Domain shapefile need to be projected into latlong in Sphere.  Created a subfunction to get latlong projection from pszProj4
  b. Change latlong in Sphere to latlong in WGS84
  c. Project domain shapefile in latlong in WGS84 to NLCD NAD83 

  But, from GDAL we found out that PROJ4 treats NAD83 and WGS84 the same.  So, we will use the original programs, not the *new1.cpp.

3. Made: make install for SA and GDAL to be installed in SAROOT/bin dir.

4. Change Time dimension to be unlimited in netcdf output.
