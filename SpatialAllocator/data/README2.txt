The coordinates for these data files are in a Lambert Conformal conic map projection, with standard parallels 33 and 45 degrees, a central meridian of -97 degrees, and the latitude of the projection origin is 40 degrees. The ellipsoid used for the Earth is a spheroid. <b>Note: This is a different map projection than is used for the output grid in the example case.</b> The <a href=../data/README.txt>README.txt</a> file in the data directory has additional information on these input shapefiles. If you wish to view these in a GIS with other files, it is recommended that you convert these to a latitude-longitude projection using the <b>convert_shape</b> script provided with this program (but be sure to set the projection parameters by adjusting the INPUT_FILE_MAP_PRJN and OUTPUT_FILE_MAP_PRJN variables in the script before you run it). Alternatively, you may download <a href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/mims/spatial/zip/spatial_data_latlon.zip">data files that have already been converted to latitude-longitude</a> and visualize those.
