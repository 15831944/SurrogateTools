OUTPUT_GRID_NAME,CONUS12k_444x336,This is a grid name for output area.
GRIDDESC,./GRIDDESC.txt,It is the file containing the list of available of grids (needed only for SMOKE surrogates).
OUTPUT_FILE_ELLIPSOID,"+a=6370000.0,+b=6370000.0",Output grid projection ellipsoid for the grid.
OUTPUT DIRECTORY,C:\Users\dyang\projects\SA\output\,Directory for individual surrogate files

LOG FILE NAME,C:\Users\dyang\projects\SA\srg_conus12.log,log file to store all information from running the program
DENOMINATOR_THRESHOLD,0.0005,surrogate ratio is output as comment line with # sign if denominator of surrogate ratio computation is less than the threshold
COMPUTE SURROGATES,YES,"It can be YES or NO.  If YES is selected, srgcreate is called to compute surrogates."
