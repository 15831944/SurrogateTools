Adding Merge Constraints

 1. Merge rows only if all of the surrgates have a atleast one entry per countyId

 2. When merge, check result total(==1.0) only if initial total for the county is 1.

DataStructure

!Need a list of all the counties

!A Variable to denote whether the county exist in all the surrogates (bool)

!A Variable to denote whether the total accross all the counties is 1 (bool)

!When you read the file

 !Need intial total for all the counties

 !From this produce a union of list of counties

   !check whether this id is exist in all the counties if so true, else false

   !check the total equal to 1 (TOLERANCE) in all the surrogates. If so true, else false

   !



OutPUt:

 !For(List of all counties)

    !IF existAll = true

      

 

   

!!



What I have now:

 track[]= store the indices for all the surrogates

 min(track[])

 get the minSurrogate

 for(size-track)

  minSrg = srg(track[i])

  if exist all

      merge 

	before put 0, you can check, whether check with the data structure 

	otherwise you have tp move the ds:

     all so check the total for a county if initial total is 1.

 	

  else 

   Print a warning message 

   move all surrogates pointers to next county ID.
