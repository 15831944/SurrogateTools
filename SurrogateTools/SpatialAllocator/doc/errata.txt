The following bugs/issues are still being worked on:

Negative areas encountered when reading latlon gridded shapefiles written by the SA itself

compare surrogates for point and line files

chunking in ALLOCATE mode and surrogate creator not currently supported

Average mode for points and lines does not account for attributes (avg1Poly
function) --needs more testing to understand what is taking place

GPC Union problem--add code to prevent duplicate outputs
- will need to write a filter to catch redundancie, mostly encountered 
  when overlaying line shapefiles

Average of point and line attributes is not working (avg1Poly function)

NONE as weight attribute for allocate mode--does it make sense?

max overlap algorithm robustness problem to handle case where sum of 
  pieces causes overlap to be greater than another case, but individual
  pieces do not

centroid algorithm improvement - currently is just avg of xs and avg of ys

PointFile attributes are all treated like strings, there is no type
differentiation in a PointFile; this would need to be corrected to 
support proper allocation of values in the point file
