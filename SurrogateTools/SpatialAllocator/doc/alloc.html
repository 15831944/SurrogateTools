<H2>7.1. Spatially Allocating Attributes</H2>
<H3>7.1.1 Modes of the Allocator Program</H3>
<P>The allocator program supports ALLOCATE mode for operating on shapefiles, point files, polygon files, I/O API files and regular grid shapefiles. <b>NOTE: I/O API files are not currently supported on Windows.</b>  
The ALLOCATE mode allows the user to specify a grid, polygon, or point file as input to allocate 
to an output grid or polygon file. The specified attributes of the input file will be written to the output file as a spatially weighted sum or average.
For example, a user may want to aggregate county data to state data.  After running the allocator, the state boundaries would be saved as a shapefile with 
attributes (e.g., population, housing) summed from the county level for each state, as indicated by this formula: 
<br />
</P>

<p>
Using the average function, on the other hand, the attributes of a density-type property (such as population density) 
from the input file are averaged across the output polygons or grid cells.  For example, a user may 
wish to average population density from census tract polygons to a grid.  The average population 
density in each grid cell would be calculated from the tracts that intersect it using the following 
formula:
<div align="center"> <img src="average.gif" width=650> </div>
</p>
<p>Other uses of the ALLOCATE mode are to convert data from one grid to another (e.g., map the data
onto a different map projection or grid cell size), and to create the CMAQ OCEANfile from a Shapefile 
that contains land and surf zone information.  Support for the CMAQ OCEANfile was added in version 3.3, 
which was released on October 26, 2006.  In conjunction with this update, a new more general feature 
was added to compute the fraction of an output cell that is composed of various categories specified
in an attribute of an input Shapfile.  For example, if you have a Shapefile with a land use category
specified for every polygon in the Shapefile, you can use this new feature to create an I/O API file
that shows the fraction of each grid cell that was covered by each land use category. More information
on this feature is given in <A HREF=areapercentage>Section 7.1.6</a>.</p>
 
<h3>7.1.2 Allocate Mode</h3>
<P>When MIMS_PROCESSING is set to ALLOCATE (a mode that replaces both the AVERAGE and AGGREGATE 
modes from earlier versions of the Spatial Allocator), the Spatial Allocator responds to the following 
environment variables (required variables appear in bold text):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>INPUT_FILE_NAME</strong> – Name of the input file to be allocated</li>
<li><strong>INPUT_FILE_TYPE</strong> – Shapefile (point,  polygon, or gridded data), RegularGrid (a grid generated in memory from the GRIDDESC file), PointFile, or IoapiFile</li> 
<li><strong>INPUT_FILE_MAP_PRJN</strong> – The map projection of the input file (or a grid name if the input file is gridded)</li>
<li><strong>INPUT_FILE_ELLIPSOID</strong> – The ellipsoid of the input file</li>
<li>INPUT_FILE_DELIM – The delimiter that is used when INPUT_FILE_TYPE is PointFile </li>
<li>INPUT_FILE_XCOL – The name of the column containing <em>x</em> coordinates in the input file when INPUT_FILE_TYPE is PointFile</li>
<li>INPUT_FILE_YCOL – The name of the column containing <em>y</em> coordinates in the input file when INPUT_FILE_TYPE is PointFile </li>
<li>INPUT_GRID_NAME – Name of input grid when INPUT_FILE_TYPE is RegularGrid</li>
<li><b>ALLOCATE_ATTRS</b> – Comma-separated list of attributes from the input file to allocate and propagate to the output file; can also be set to the keyword ALL</li>
<li><strong>ALLOC_MODE_FILE</strong> – The name of a file that lists the attributes in the input file to carry through to the output file and the types of the attributes.
As an alternative to specifying a file name, ALL_AGGREGATE, ALL_AVERAGE, ALL_AREAPERCENT, ALL_DISCRETEOVERLAP, and ALL_DISCRETECENTROID are recognized keywords that 
will apply the requested algorithm to all the attributes specified by ALLOCATE_ATTRS.</li>
<li>ALLOC_ATTR_TYPE - Specify SURF_ZONE if you are trying to create a CMAQ OCEANfile.</li>
<li><strong>OUTPUT_FILE_NAME</strong> – The directory and name of the output file</li>
<li><strong>OUTPUT_FILE_TYPE</strong> – The type of the output file; valid values are RegularGrid, Shapefile (polygons only), or IoapiFile</li>
<li><strong>OUTPUT_FILE_ELLIPSOID</strong> – Ellipsoid of the polygons in the output file</li>  
<li><strong>OUTPUT_FILE_MAP_PRJN</strong> – The map projection of the output file (if output is not gridded)</li> 
<li>OUTPUT_POLY_FILE &ndash; The name of a shapefile that specifies the geometry of the output polygons when OUTPUT_FILE_TYPE is Shapefile 
<li>OUTPUT_POLY_TYPE &ndash; The type of the file specifying the geometry of the output polygons.  Currently, only Shapefile is supported.
<li>OUTPUT_POLY_ATTRS &ndash; A list of attributes to be carried over from the OUTPUT_POLY_FILE to the output file.</li>
<li>OUTPUT_POLY_ELLIPSOID &ndash; The ellipsoid of the shapes in OUTPUT_POLY_FILE</li>  
<li>OUTPUT_POLY_MAP_PRJN (formerly POLY_DATA_MAP_PRJN) &ndash; The map projection of the shapes in OUTPUT_POLY_FILE </li>
<li>GRIDDESC – The name of the GRIDDESC file that describes all grids</li>
<li>OUTPUT_GRID_NAME – The name of the output grid (when OUTPUT_FILE_TYPE is RegularGrid)</li>
<li>MAX_LINE_SEG - Specifies the maximum length of a line segment to use when re
ading in a line or polygon Shapefile or creating the polygons for a grid. Any li
ne segments longer than the specified length will be split to be no longer than
the length specified by this variable. This could be useful when converting data
 on one grid to another, as the spatial mapping can be done more precisely when
the grid is described by more points than just the four corners. Note that apply
ing this feature will make the program run more slowly.</li>
<li><b>DEBUG_OUTPUT</b> – Y or N (specifies whether to write the informational messages to standard output; setting this to N will make the program  output only critical information)</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.1.3 Allocate Mode Examples</h3> 
<P>Example allocate scripts are provided for Unix/Linux in C-shell format (.csh extension appended) and 
 for Microsoft Windows in DOS batch file format (.bat extension appended). These scripts can be executed directly from the scripts 
 directory. If desired, you may edit the aggregate script and set the BASDIR to your new installation folder. 
 The scripts place their output shapefiles in the output directory. The output files can be viewed with a GIS. </P>

<P>There are several different allocation examples provided in the sample scripts that cover various combinations of data and file types. The sample scripts for the allocate mode are: </P>
<ul><li>alloc_census_tracts_to_grid</li>
<li>alloc_census_tracts_to_county</li>
<li>alloc_census_tracts_to_ioapi</li>
<li>alloc_gridpop_to_biggrid</li>
<li>alloc_emis_to_grid</li>
<li>alloc_ports_to_county</li>
</ul>

<p>The UNIX version of the alloc_census_tracts_to_county script is presented below as an
 example of a fairly typical allocate mode script. The attributes input file 
 (a shapefile in this case) is processed according to the entries in an allocate mode file, 
 atts_pophous.txt, which has entries for each of the three attributes (POP2000, HOUSEHOLDS, and HDENS) 
 specified by ALLOCATE_ATTRS that will be aggregated or averaged. The input file is intersected with 
 OUTPUT_POLY_FILE, which is also a shapefile.  The OUTPUT_POLY_FILE attributes specified in 
 OUTPUT_POLY_ATTRS (e.g., FIPS_CODE and COUNTY) will carry over to the output file specified by OUTPUT_FILE_NAME (county_pophous).

echo "Allocating census population tract to counties"
$TIME $EXE
</pre>
<br />
The above example is a fairly typical allocate mode script.  The attributes input file (a shapefile in this case) is processed according to the 
entries in an allocate mode file, <a href="atts_pophous.txt">atts_pophous.txt</a>, which has entries for each
of the three attributes (POP2000, HOUSEHOLDS, and HDENS) specified by ALLOCATE_ATTRS that will be aggregated or averaged.  The input file is
intersected with OUTPUT_POLY_FILE, which is also a shapefile and whose attributes specified in 
OUTPUT_POLY_ATTRS (FIPS_CODE and COUNTY) 
will carry over to county_pophous, the output file specified by OUTPUT_FILE_NAME. <br /> 
</p>

<h3>7.1.4 Allocating Discrete Values</h3>
<p>Previous versions of the Spatial Allocator supported the allocation of only continuous data types, i.e., those that could have
mathematical operations such as aggregation or averaging performed on them.  
Discrete attributes such as FIPS codes or county names could not previously be allocated due to this limitation. In the Spatial Allocator version 3.0, you can now allocate discrete attributes based on maximum area of overlap (the value of the attribute is obtained from the input shape that has the largest overlap with the output shape) or based on the centroid (the value of the attributes is obtained from the input shape that contains the centroid of the output shape).  Allocation of discrete attributes
is mainly for polygon data, but point and line shapes can be used with the maximum overlap (points are simply counted as an area of 1.0 each, so the first point encountered that overlaps the output shape will be used, while line length is substituted for area for line shapes).  The centroid method does not make sense when applied to point or line data, so this condition will generate
an error in the program.  </p>
<p>The following C-shell script depicts how to allocate discrete variables from a county shapefile onto a grid.
The ALLOC_MODE_FILE environment variable specifies the name of an <a href="#modefile">ASCII mode file</a> just as it did in the previous example.  
This time, the attributes of interest are discrete, so the processing modes used are DISCRETE_CENTROID and
DISCRETE_OVERLAP.  As an aside, when OUTPUT_FILE_TYPE is set to RegularGrid, the OUTPUT_POLY related environment variables are
omitted because the grid is generated in memory from the grid description file and the column and row attributes
are added automatically.

setenv OUTPUT_FILE_ELLIPSOID "+a=6370997.0,+b=6370997.0"

#echo "Allocating counties to a grid"
$TIME $EXE
</pre>

The mode file used for this example, excluding comments or whitespace appears as follows:
<a name="modefile"></a>
<pre>ATTRIBUTE=FIPS_CODE:DISCRETE_CENTROID
ATTRIBUTE=COUNTY:DISCRETE_OVERLAP</pre>

</p>


<h3>7.1.5 Discretization Interval</h3>
<p>
Using the MAX_LINE_SEG environment variable, users can specify a maximum line segment length for lines, polygons,
and generated grid cells in the units of the output file.  Allocations of attributes will appear no different.  This feature comes into play when
converting shapes between map projections where the conversion algorithms cause distortions in long line
segments (those used in a grid, for example).  To set a discretization interval, add </p>
<pre>setenv MAX_LINE_SEG &lt;length&gt;
</pre>
<p> to your script, where &lt;length&gt; is an integer value in the same units as the shape being processed.  Thus,
an 8-km (8000-m) grid processed with a discretization interval of 1000 will break up any line segment of 1000 meters
or more.  Please note that there is a performance penalty incurred when using the discretization
interval; the smaller the interval value, the longer the program will take to run because the line-splitting
algorithm will be calculating where to add all the extra points.
</p>

<h3>7.1.6 Computing Area Percentages for the CMAQ OCEANfile and Other Uses</h3>
<p>Support for the CMAQ OCEANfile and for area percentages in general was added in version 3.3, 
which was released on October 26, 2006.  The purpose of this update, is to compute the fraction of an output 
cell that is composed of various categories specified in an attribute of an input Shapfile.  For example, 
if you have a Shapefile with a land use category specified for every polygon in the Shapefile, you can use 
this new feature to create an I/O API file that shows the fraction of each grid cell that was covered by 
each land use category. Note that the only output format currently supported for this new mode
is IoapiFile, but the feature could some day be extended to also output Shapefiles. There are
two new scripts available with the distribution that illustrate the use of this new mode:</p>
<pre>
alloc_surf_zone_to_oceanfile.csh: allocates the surf zone Shapefile to create an OCEANfile
alloc_types_to_areapercent.csh: allocates the surf zone Shapefile using the standard area
allocation mode (i.e., variables will be Type_2 and Type_3 instead of SURF_ZONE and OCEAN).  
</pre>
<p>To trigger an area percentage run:
<ol>
<li>Set the value of the ALLOC_MODE_FILE to ALL_AREAPERCENT.  Note that we have not performed any tests that 
mixes the AREAPERCENT mode with other modes in the same mode file, so it may not work properly to do that, 
but using AREAPERCENT for all specified attributes does work.
<li>Set the ALLOC_ATTRS variable to specify the name of the variable that specifies the
 types of polygons (e.g., this is set to TYPE in the case of the OCEANfile).
<li>If you specifically wish to generate an OCEANfile, set the value of ALLOC_ATTR_TYPE
variable to SURF_ZONE.  This tells the program to output OCEAN and SURF_ZONE, and is not 
needed for a more generic area percentage run.
</li>
</ol><p>
For the data file that is input to the surf zone calculation for most of North America, check 
the site <a href=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/>http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/</a>.  The
Spatial section has input files for spatial surrogates, and the Biogenic has inputs for biogenic
processing and it is likely that the OCEANfile input will be posted in this section.
