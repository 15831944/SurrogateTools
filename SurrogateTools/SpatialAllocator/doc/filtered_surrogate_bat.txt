::******************* Filtered Surrogate Run Script **************************
:: This script generates a filtered surrogate based on the MIMS spatial 
:: allocator test case :: (8km over Tennessee).
::
:: Be sure to specify FILTERED_WEIGHT_SHAPES and FILTER_FILE, as those are the
:: main things different from generating an ordinary surrogate.
