<H2><A name="future"></a>9. Future Enhancements</H2>
<p>Version 3.0 includes many new enhancements suggested by users. Additional future enhancements  under consideration for implementation include:
  
<ul>
  <li>Support Shapefile as an output of OVERLAY mode.</li>
  <li>Support IoapiFile as an input to OVERLAY mode.</li>
  <li>Support I/O API Files as inputs and outputs on Windows.</li>
  <li>Refine the support for allocating an I/O API file to a Shapefile.
Currently only the first time step and layer of data will be allocated and 
output to the Shapefile.</li>
  <li>Support input file "chunking" in modes other than OVERLAY mode, including the capability to process a grid in parts.</li>
  <li>Modify srgmerge to take inputs from environment variables when only one surrogate is being merged or gap-filled.</li>
  <li>Properly allocate numeric values read in from PointFiles - this will require specifying the information about the attribute type somehow.</li>
  <li>Optionally add an extra surrogate line for counties on the edge of the grid that would allow the value for grid cell "0,0" to represent the amount of the surrogate that fell outside the grid. This would cause surrogates for counties on the edge of the grid to sum to 1.</li>
  <li>Provide support for reading data from the new ArcGIS database format.</li>
  <li>Support gap filling and merging in the same execution of srgmerge.</li>
  <li>Allow the value for OUTSRG= to span multiple lines.</li>
</ul>
