<H2><A name="test case"></a>3.1. Download and Installation</H2>
<P>
  The suite of programs and utilities that comprise the Spatial Allocator are written in C, with the exception of srgmerge which is written in C++. To date the software suite has been tested on linux and Windows XP systems.  Identical results have been obtained in every case.</p>
  
<p>To download and install the program, perform the following steps:</p>
<OL TYPE=a>
  <LI>Download the executables for your computer's operating system (e.g.,<a href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/mims/spatial/zip/mims_spatial_1_2008_Linux.tar.gz">Red Hat Linux</A>, 
  <A href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/mims/spatial/zip/mims_spatial_10_2006_Win32.zip">Windows</A>) and unzip this into the installation folder. Alternatively, you may build your own executables from the source code (see the README files in the src directory). <br>
  &nbsp;
  <LI>Download the <A href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/mims/spatial/zip/mimssp_1_2008.zip"> source code, scripts, and documentation</A>. Unzip this file into a new installation folder with at least 40 MB of available disk space. <br>
&nbsp;
  <LI>Download the <A href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/mims/spatial/zip/spatial_data.zip">input data files (60 MB)</A> and unzip them into the installation folder. The coordinates for these data files are in a Lambert Conformal conic map projection, with standard parallels 33 and 45 degrees, a central meridian of -97 degrees, and the latitude of the projection origin is 40 degrees. The ellipsoid used for the Earth is a spheroid. <b>Note: This is a different map projection than is used for the output grid in the example case.</b> The <a href=../data/README.txt>README.txt</a> file in the data directory has additional information on these input shapefiles. If you wish to view these in a GIS with other files, it is recommended that you convert these to a latitude-longitude projection using the <b>convert_shape</b> script provided with this program (but be sure to set the projection parameters by adjusting the INPUT_FILE_MAP_PRJN and OUTPUT_FILE_MAP_PRJN variables in the script before you run it). Alternatively, you may download <a href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/mims/spatial/zip/spatial_data_latlon.zip">data files that have already been converted to latitude-longitude</a> and visualize those. <br>
&nbsp;
  <li>If you are interested in the E-Grid, you can download an  <a href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/mims/spatial/zip/egrid_arc.dat.gz">example E-Grid file</a><br></li>
  <br>&nbsp;
  <li>If you are interested in the surf zone computation, you can download this <a href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/mims/spatial/zip/surfzone_poly_st.zip">country boundaries file</a><br></li>
  <br>&nbsp;
  <li>If you are interested in preparing beld3 inputs to SMOKE, you can download this <a href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/mims/spatial/zip/tile10.tar.gz">beld tile data</a>. Note: this data is about 1GB unzipped.<br></li>
  <br>&nbsp;
  <li>If you are interested in the Surrogate Tools, which help manage the process of creating surrogate files that are inputs to SMOKE and to quality assure surrogate data, see <a href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/mims/spatial/srgtool">the Surrogate Tools web page</a>. </li>
  <br>&nbsp;
  
  <LI>After you have unzipped the above files, you should see the following directories in your installation folder: <b>data, doc, scripts, src, </b> and <b>testsuite</b>. The executables named <b>allocator</b>, <b>srgcreate</b>, <b>beld3smk</b>, <b>srgmerge</b>, <b>diffsurr</b>, <b>diffioapi</b>, and <b>dbf2asc</b> should be visible directly in the installation folder. <B>NOTE: the beld3smk and diffioapi programs are not currently available for Windows.</b><br>
  &nbsp;
  
  <li><b>For additional input data, check the EPA site <a href=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/>http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/</a></b>.
   The Spatial section has data used to create surrogates, and the Biogenic section (<a href=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/biogenic/>http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/biogenic/)</a>  has data 
   used to create SMOKE biogenic-related input files.'
